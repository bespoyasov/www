# Kazan, July 2017

I was in Kazan two years ago. The standard tourist route has not changed, but the embankment and the parks have become cooler.

It's more convenient to start walking from Bauman Street, it's the main pedestrian street:

It will lead to the Kazan Kremlin:

There's also the Kul Sharif mosque and the “Falling” tower:

The pavement is cool <nobr>:-)</nobr>

It's nice to walk around the city in general, you meet some nice details:

I didn't get a good picture of the Agricultural Palace last time or this time:

The Black Lake Park was promised to be improved two years ago:

And they did! The park has added playgrounds and public spaces. Here, for example, an outdoor stage with a canopy (I didn't take a picture of the canopy for some reason, it's on my left):

The facades next to the park are freshened up:

The park wasn't fully opened, just part of it. Just a real iterative launch <nobr>:-)</nobr>

The Kremlin Embankment is really cool:
