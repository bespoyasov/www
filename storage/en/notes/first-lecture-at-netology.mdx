# First Lecture at Netology

I now give lectures at [Netology](https://netology.ru/). On Monday I gave the first one: talked about web layout and positioning systems.

It took me a month to prepare, but almost screwed up anyway. Learn from my <nobr>mistakes :–D</nobr>

## Missed Broken Link on Slide

I made a set of slides for the lecture. On one of those slides, there were a broken link which I noticed only during class.

I checked the text and examples 3 times each, but did not notice that the link on one of the slides led to an example from the previous one.

So as not to make a mistake again, I will click every link and compare the page with its title. And also I will read the text from the end, so that mistakes would be more noticeable.

## Had Long Pauses During Lecture Because of Anxiety

I wrote an accompanying text and a outline for when to change the current slide. I merged both things in one document.

The text helped not to forget anything, but the script was a distraction. Next time I will make them separate, it will help keep the focus on the main topic.

## Hard to Speak Without Seeing Audience

Netology is an online university, so in terms of feedback there's only a chat. It's hard to lead the lecture when it's impossible to see if the students follow the topic.

Next time I will imagine that I'm telling a lecture to my students as if they were sitting next to me. I will choose easier examples and simpler words to make the explanation even clearer.

I will have the second lesson on November 2. To be better prepared, I will use all the experience from the first one. Good luck <nobr>to me :-)</nobr>.
