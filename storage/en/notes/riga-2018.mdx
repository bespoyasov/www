# Riga, March 2018

The first thing that catches your eye in Riga is the wild number of casinos and their advertisements. They are everywhere: on the outskirts, in the center, in the old town, in the underpasses.

The old town looks beautiful though. All it would take away is the unnecessary signage.

Black houses are a separate awesomeness:

There's one of these, too:

There's a nice view from St. Peter's Church:

There's not a bad park downtown:

Of the museums, I suggest the military museum:

And Corner House,” the former KGB building:

The zoo is all bad with navigation. It's hard to find, easy to get lost, that's all.

Probably the cutest parking pole I've ever seen:

Yeah and it's all pretty nice overall:
