# Web UI for My Latest Book

Today I launch a [web UI for my book “Refactor Like a Superhero”](https://refactor-like-a-superhero.vercel.app/en)! 🎉

The goal of this UI is to make it more comfortable to read, navigate, and search the book contents. Each chapter has quick access to its sections and other chapters. Accents and important side notes are now highlighted and easier to find.

...And, of course, it has the dark theme!

## Technologies

The site is built using SvelteKit and deployed on Vercel. In the future, I plan to write more about these technologies and compare Svelte with React.

For me, it seems like Svelte is a serious competitor to other frontend frameworks, at least in the field of statically generated sites. I want to share my experience and some thoughts on this topic.

## Reasons

Originally, I [published](/blog/refactor-like-a-superhero/) the book on GitHub.

It felt okay at first, but GitHub's `.md` parser aggressively trims styling and semantics of many elements. I decided to fix that and publish the book with correct semantics and better (subjectively! 😄) styles.

The book is still [available on GitHub](https://github.com/bespoyasov/refactor-like-a-superhero) in case you want to read it there, leave feedback about the content, or fix a typo in the text.
