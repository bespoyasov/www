# Prague, August 2019

Summer Prague is cooler than [winter Prague](/blog/czech-republic-2017/).

The first thing that caught my eye was the water. In winter, the Vltava river does not catch the eye the way it does in summer. Just look at it:

And the city in general is more interesting to look at in summer for some reason. Either you can see more details, or it's just warm and you don't have to run anywhere to get warm:

I've already made a big deal about the transportation system in [last time](/blog/czech-republic-2017/). Today I'm going to show you a museum of public transportation.

The museum is located on the site of the old tram depot. The trams in it are on the move, once a year they have a festival, and they take them for a ride through the city.

With transportation, it's a buzzkill out there in general. For example, the funicular to Vyšehrad is also considered public transportation, so you don't need a separate ticket for it.

Vyšehrad itself isn't particularly interesting unless you climb to the observation deck. From there, it is sometimes possible to see things between the trees:

And here's the place I wasn't expecting anything at all that turned out to be the most awesome—Letná Park.

The park is on a hill, next to the river, and there's a great view of the whole town. The DJs there at night are making great music. I don't know if a picture can capture the atmosphere:

Of the places I don't particularly recommend is the Kafka Museum.

A relatively good one is the Museum of Modern Art.

He has a knack for “talking” to visitors:

Yeah, and the exhibit was okay, too:

Prague is cool, come and see it sometime.
