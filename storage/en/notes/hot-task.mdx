# Hot Task

A hot task is an urgent or important task for you.

Such tasks cause more emotions than usual ones. Fear of not meeting expectations, wanting to do more than you can, fear of not having enough time to complete the taskâ€”all these emotions only interfere with your work.

When you receive a hot task, _relax and exhale_. Treat it like a normal, regular task. And after that, get to work.

The less nervous and rushed you are, the easier it is to find a solution. A calm head works better.
