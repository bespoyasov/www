# St. Petersburg, August 2018

Peter is cooler in summer than in winter, of course. From the “what to see” things I can recommend [Grand Model](https://grandmaket.ru):

The details are awesome. Queues at Sberbank:

Memes about “the manager, the customer, the project manager, and you.”

I couldn't get into the Hermitage last time, this time I did:

[New Holland](http://www.newhollandsp.ru) is nice. Comfortable chairs, soft lawn, quiet:
