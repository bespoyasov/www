# Warsaw, December 2017

The old city in Warsaw is beautiful.

You might find some old lanterns.

The fortress is beautiful in its own right, but the best part is the courtyards near and inside.

Walls and arches.

Among the new architecture, you can find this kind of thing.

There are also glass cubes placed around the city with reproductions of paintings depicting the places where the cubes stand.

There are several vantage points in the city. Here in the old town.

Everything was decorated for Christmas in December.

Next to the Copernicus monument, a model of the solar system has been laid out on the ground. Here's the sun.

At the Copernicus Science Center, we were stuck for a couple of hours. Instead of exhibits there are physics experiments. Spoilers in my head, but still interesting.

Happy holidays!
