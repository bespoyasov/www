# Scroller Upgrade

I finally got around to updating [Scroller](https://bespoyasov.ru/scroller/). Here's what changed.

## No Dependencies

You no longer need jQuery and jTweener. The script is lightweight nowâ€”the minified version is only 20 KB.

## New APIs

You can now scroll the content programmatically and update the settings on the fly. The old methods and setting via attributes still work.

## Package is Now On npm

I don't remember how I missed it last time. Fixed now.

## Better Performance

It now scrolles the content smoother due to the software acceleration. Inertia effect now feels nicer.

## No IE Below 11

If support for older browsers is important to you, try an older version of Scroller. It works in IE as of version 9.

## React Component

I also made [a wrapper for React](https://github.com/bespoyasov/react-scroller), so that you could use Scroller in you r React apps.

If you have any questions, or if you find a bug, send them to [email](mailto:bespoyasov@me.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com/bespoyasov/scroller/issues).
