# How I Improved My Daily Routine and Why

For two months now, I have been following a daily schedule. On weekdays I get up at 6 AM, exercise, shower, have breakfast, and start working.

In this post, I want to discuss the benefits of a daily routine, and why you should try to have a routine too.

## Benefits

Initially, I wanted to improve my productivity and sleep. Here's what I managed to achieve.

### Improved Planning

Following a routing taught me how to plan my day better so that I don't stay up late into the night.

### Found Some Extra Time

I found time for sports. I used to try working out in the evenings or during the day before. The problem was that I often didn't have the energy to exercise in the evening because of a busy day. So my workouts were irregular and hence used to stop.

Now I have no problem with that. Half an hour in the morning before work is enough for me.

### Started Completing More Tasks

I used to take time for some tasks in the evening or at night. But at that time my head works worse than in the morning. Now I try to tackle the most difficult tasks in the morning—it helps unload the schedule for the rest of the day.

As a result, I spend the most productive time to the most important and difficult tasks and procrastinate much less than before.

## Constraints

The daily routine has some constraints and requires some initial push. For example, I...

### Have to Go to Bed Early

At first it seems better to sit down an extra hour in the evening and tackle a task now than to leave it for the morning. But the benefit of this is often imaginary. So I have to force myself to go to bed to have 6-8 hours of sleep before the next day.

The most difficult part is, of course, convince myself that in the morning I'll solve the task faster and better.

Sometimes I miss the time to go to bed anyway and fall asleep later, so...

### Have to Keep the Routine

So even if I go to bed at 2, I still get up at 6 the next day. Yup, I'll be sleepy, but I'll be motivated to plan my day differently next time, so I don't have to go to bed late again.

### Have to Give Myself Rest on Weekends

On Saturday and Sunday I get up at 8. Sleeping longer on weekends gives variety and rest. Without that the routine would become boring and I would abandon it.

## Bottom Line

Overall for me, the benefits outweighed the constraints. Try it out, maybe you'll like it too :–)
