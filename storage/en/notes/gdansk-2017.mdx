# Gdansk, October 2017

Gdansk turned out to be an interesting city with a beautiful historical center. The main street Dluga is completely pedestrian. Most of the sights can be collected by walking along it and nearby:

Cool facades:

But it does happen in yards <nobr>:-)</nobr>

Sometimes the streets get this narrow:

There is water in the city too, the Motlawa River:

St. Catherine's Church:

Things aren't always good with advertising and signage either:

If you're in Gdansk, be sure to go to the World War II museum. It's probably the strongest exhibit I've seen.

The whole museum was built around two tanks.

I wouldn't recommend going to the ferris wheel, though:
