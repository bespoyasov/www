# Tzlvt Update!

Users asked us to add dollars and euros to [Tzlvt](/projects/tzlvt). We knew that if we added these currencies, we would have to add a comma to the keyboard so the users could enter cents.

This was technically expensive, so we procrastinated with the update for a long time. But now it's finally here!

The update is available:

- On [AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tzlvt/id1093713971?ls=1&mt=8) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.bespoyasov.tzlvt) for iOS and Android:
- As the [web version](https://fuckgrechka.ru/tzlvt/) of the app for all platforms.

Also, I started working on refactoring and improving the code base so that we could ship new features faster and smoother. If you are interested in helping me with this or you know someone who can help, please email me at bespoyasov@me.com.
