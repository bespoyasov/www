# Krakow, April 2018

So far, Krakow is the most interesting city in Poland. The first thing worth seeing is Wawel Castle. In it, the Polish kings were crowned even after the capital was moved from Krakow to Warsaw.

There were bubbles blowing in the main square every day while we were in town. From what I understand, it's not a one-time event.

There is a main market in the same square, and underneath the market is an archaeological museum. Excavations were done right on the main square in 2005, the museum has a photo gallery.

The square itself looks typical for Europe. Love it!

And from above, it's like this:

Away from the center stands St. Joseph's Church.

There are beautiful views of the Vistula river, too:

There are horse-drawn carriages racing through Krakow. It costs about £100 to ride one. I don't know who rides them or why, but here it is.

There are parks, too:

“Schindler's Factory” is more about the war in general than it is about Schindler.

Transportation is great: navigation is clear, trams go often.

The stops are neat.

Speed is reduced by roundabouts.

The doors in Krakow are a sight to behold.

![...All wooden](/images/content/krakow-2018/36.jpg)

There's an alley of stars of its own.

If you're lucky, you can stay in an apartment with a view of the city. We were half lucky.

It's a beautiful city, all in all.
