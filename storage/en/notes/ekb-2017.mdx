# Yekaterinburg, May 2017

Yekaterinburg seemed to me like an “almost, but not quite” city. It's like it's trying to surprise you, but it doesn't succeed. I'm not an expert in urbanism or something, I just have this feeling.

For example, there's a “red line” in the city, which leads tourists around the sights. At the same time, it leads to a run-down embankment that smells like swamp because of standing water.

There is a steep skyscraper with an observation deck. But from there it's interesting to look only at the river. The houses are the same-square, sparse development with lots of vacant lots.

So, here are some pictures, just to show you how it is.

There is a beautiful pond with ducks in Rastorguev-Kharitonov park. But you can not approach it, because the road is broken, and the gazebo is also broken.

The observation deck on the 52nd floor of the Vysotsky tower offers a cool view of the river. But you have to turn your head the other way and it's already boring.

The beautiful Church on the Blood doesn't really save the day—you just can't see it among the identical houses.

The skyscraper itself is cool and all... But the houses next to it have a facade that's falling apart. The last picture is from the red line.

The tram tracks are nicely laid out, it doesn't even shake on them. But you still have to try to get to the stop.

You can find cool views of the Iset River . But the profile of the city doesn't draw the eye.

The Yeltsin Center is an interesting place though. The building itself, the exhibits are cool. The tour with the story about the 90's was probably the most interesting. When in Yekaterinburg, go for sure.

The Vysotsky Museum seemed less interesting.

The trees there are cut in shapes :-)

Fast food war.

You can get around town in a day or a day and a half.
