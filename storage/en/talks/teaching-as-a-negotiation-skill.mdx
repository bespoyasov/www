# Teaching as a Negotiation Skill

A talk at a Netology University meetup where I taught for two and a half years. In this talk I discuss how teaching helps you to communicate more effectively, and where else it is useful.

Specifically, we discuss how teaching helps in:

- working on daily projects;
- email communication;
- finding out the pains of clients and users;
- understanding the other person's world;
- explaining your point of view.
