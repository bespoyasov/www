# My 2024 or Why I've Been so Quiet

My blog and social media have been quiet this year. I haven't published a single article and have hardly appeared on any social media. Today, I want to tell why.

This post won't be particularly useful like the others, it's more of an attempt to reflect on my 2024. If you're not interested in such posts, you can safely skip this one.

## Failure of the Year

I've been working on a new book in my spare time all year. I'm not yet ready to tell what it's about or to promise a publication date because I'm still not sure I'll have the energy to finish it. But I can tell what problems have risen during that time.

### Main Issues

Working on the draft was difficult: the progress was fickle, results seemed unsatisfactory, and the invested time and effort seemed unjustifiably huge. Twice I considered stopping the work without finishing the draft.

The main problems, as I now see them, were four:

**The audience I was writing for was initially overly broad.** I thought I would reach readers ranging from novice developers to middle-plus engineers, but by mid-year, it became clear that I had tried to bite off more than I could chew.

The amount of material was too much, and some of it was more useful for experienced developers rather than beginners. I didn't notice that at first and tried to bring the narrative in such a way as to cover all.

That's why it was hard to “just explain what I wanted to explain”: beginners would lack a lot of context that needed to be explained first, and more experienced developers would be bored by these explanations. As a result, I spent a lot of effort trying to “connect unconnectable” without getting results.

**The topic is complex and requires a lot of adjacent knowledge.** Again, I had to make a choice: either to talk about these adjacent topics on my own or to assume that readers should already know about them.

In the first case, I noticed that there was _too much_ of adjacent material, and the book began to talk about “everything.” In the second case, however, the pursuit of a wide audience pushed me to keep most of these topics.

Because of this problem, I tried to rewrite the draft eight times, trying to approach the topic from different angles and looking for an adequate narrative line.

**The code samples I prepared turned out to be too excessive.** The domain of the application I used as code samples is not similar to a “standard e-commerce site,” so it should be explained to the readers first, and it was difficult to do it because of the number of features in the written application.

Besides, to show examples in different programming paradigms and using several typical React stacks, I implemented the same application in several variants. To cram all this into a text so that it would be consistent and understandable was too difficult.

**Finally, the fear of not getting the book published before “something happens”** made it seem as if I had harsh deadlines. What exactly is going to happen? Anything: AI destroys programming, another author publishes the same book before me, React changes again beyond recognition—my restless brain is genius when it comes to generating such ideas.

These “deadlines” coupled with, as it seemed at the time, zero work output created such an oppressive environment that I don't even want to think about it. It was not only completely useless to work in such a state, but also simply harmful.

### Attempts to Solve Them

In the middle of the year, I decided to completely rethink two aspects: who I write for and what to focus on.

I decided to drastically reduce the target audience by focusing on middle/middle-plus level developers. To do this, I had to formulate and greatly expand the list of topics and technologies that readers will already need to know before reading this book.

In addition, I fixed a list of topics that I'm _not going to write about_. That is, instead of keeping in mind what I “should describe” in the book, I started reminding myself “what I definitely won't talk about.”

I cut back on the code examples, too. I didn't change the stack variations or the application domain (because reasons), but I did drastically reduce the number of features in the app, leaving only a few to cover the discussed topics.

I'm still not sure if this will let me get the job done, but at least at the end of the year, I had a more-or-less clear narrative plan, which is good, but...

### Consequences

Working excessively for a year without seeing tangible results is not healthy. It's exhausting, draining, discouraging, and gives me the illusion that I've “forgotten how to write.”

Even when I alternated the type of work I was doing, like switching between code and text, I still noticed that I was putting in more and more effort and seeing fewer results. It was frightening and discouraging. By September, I noticed that the mere thought of “writing” was repulsive.

Of course, there was no more energy, time, or desire for any other posts. This post I'm writing on a long vacation, during which I haven't touched the book in three weeks. The fact that I can produce some coherent text is reassuring, but the fear of continuing is still there.

I think next year I'm going to try to finish the draft as I envision it now. If it works, great, I'll move on to editing and finding a publisher. If not, then I'll have to accept that the project was a bit too much for me and stop it.

## Relief of the Year

But hey, there's always a blessing in disguise somewhere, innit! Along with my time for blogging, my time for social media disappeared, and that turned out to be one of the most rewarding things that happened this year.

In general, I've already started posting on social media much less often since 2021, but this year I've become much less likely to read them and to show up on them in general.

I noticed a particularly strong relief, of course, when I stopped reading Twitter. The amount of hate that was pouring out through the screen every day was somewhat excessive.

Out of inertia, I started limiting my presence on other social media as well. They're certainly not as toxic as Twitter, but they, too, seem unnecessary now. So far, the hardest thing to do is probably to limit my time on YouTube, but we'll see—maybe that will be my goal for next year.

## Next Year

I don't feel like making grand plans now at all, so I'm going to be cautious and:

- Try to determine if I can finish the draft of the book
- And if I can't, try to stop that project without finishing
- But more importantly, try to be more careful not to burn out again

We'll see how it goes. Happy holidays!
