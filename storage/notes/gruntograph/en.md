# Typography Plugin for Grunt

[Gruntograph](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-groontograf) is a typography plugin for Grunt that makes text and HTML pretty.

It puts non-breaking spaces after prepositions, conjunctions, and short words. It changes “programmer quotes” to correct ones and fixes nested quotes. It replaces hyphens with dashes where needed and puts a short dash in ranges of numbers. It makes abbreviations small-caps and puts thin spaces in numbers and before currency signs. Knows only Russian for now.

## Installation

To install the plugin, go to the project folder via terminal and call the command:

```
npm install grunt-contrib-groontograf --save-dev
```

## Configuration

Example Grunt file:

```json
{
	"groontograf": {
		"compile": {
			"options": {
				"hang": true,
				"abbr": true,
				"halfSpaces": true,
				"styles": "inline"
			},
			"files": {
				"dest/pretty.html": "src/ugly.html"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

The plugin supports these settings:

- `hang` (`boolean`), defaults to `true`, makes hanging punctuation;
- `abbr` (`boolean`), by default `true`, makes abbreviations smallcapsed;
- `halfSpaces` (`boolean`), defaults to `true`, puts thin spaces;
- `styles` (`string`), the default `inline`, determines where to write the styles.

By default, Gruntograph writes styles to the `style` attribute of elements. If this doesn't work for you, write in options:

```json
{
	"styles": "class",
	"abbrClassName": "smallcaps",
	"hangClassName": ["hp_quote_space", "hp_quote", "hp_bracket_space", "hp_bracket"],
	"halfSpaceClassName": "halfspace"
}
```

Then instead of inline styles, Gruntograph will inject classes from the `hangClassName`, `abbrClassName` and `halfSpaceClassName` options. It's recommended to use the styles file from the package if you don't want to define styles for these classes yourself.
