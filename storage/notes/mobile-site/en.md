# Mobile Site Equals Lightweight

A mobile phone on average is less efficient than a desktop or a laptop.

To keep the site from lagging, remove unnecessary effects from mobile versions. By these effects, I mean parallax, “smooth” scrolling made with JS, complex animations. Remove resourceful stuff that doesn't add up to the site's value.

P.S. And non-native “smooth” scroll can be removed from the full version too 😁
