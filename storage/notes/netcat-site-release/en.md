# Netcat Website Upgrade

[Netcat](https://netcat.ru) is a content and online store management system. Our task was to update the appearance of its main website and move to a new design step-by-step to meet the deadlines.

In the fall, we were in the process of updating all of the site's templates. I made the layouts for the new design, programmed the UI logic and helped with the integration of the new design. We started with the home page and gradually redesigned the whole site.

We also updated the documentation page especially for developers. We divided it into sections, customized the search, and added documentation for previous CMS versions.
