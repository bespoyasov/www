# Significant Details

There are no insignificant details in the UI and UX.

An insignificant detail is something unimportant that does not affect the overall picture and does not break the system if it is missing or broken As for the UI, every “little thing” is a detail because it affects how the user interacts with the interface.

Large hover zones, clean code, clear texts, appropriate animations—all these details are significant, because together they give either a working and stable system, or an immovable mess, which is difficult to manage and maintain.
