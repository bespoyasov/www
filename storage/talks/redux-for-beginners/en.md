# State Management for Beginners

I was asked to give this talk for a group of students from Framtidst√•get, and we decided to make it a live coding session.

We took a React application that the students had written in previous classes and rewrote it using the Redux Toolkit. During the presentation we discussed:

- What is application state and how to manage it.
- Key concepts from Redux and Redux Toolkit.
- What are the benefits of RTK, whether you can write apps without it.
- Alternatives to Redux.
- Alternatives to React.
